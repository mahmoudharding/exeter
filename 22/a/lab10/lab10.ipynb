The `ads` data set consists of the sales (in thousands of units) of that product in 200 different markets, along with advertising budgets for the product in each of those markets for three different media: internet, streaming radio, and tv (all in thousands of dollars). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is not possible for our client to directly increase sales of the product. On the other hand, they can control the advertising expenditure in each of the three media. Therefore, if we determine that there is an **association between advertising and sales**, then we can instruct our client to adjust advertising budgets, thereby indirectly increasing sales. In other words, our goal is to develop an accurate model that can be used to predict sales on the basis of the three media budgets.

    "Every time you add a predictor to a model, the R-squared increases, even if due to chance alone. It never decreases. Consequently, a model with more terms may appear to have a better fit simply because it has more terms. If a model has too many predictors, it begins to model the random noise in the data. This condition is known as overfitting the model and it produces misleadingly high R-squared values and a lessened ability to make predictions.\n",

You should evaluate R-squared values in conjunction with residual plots, other model statistics (not part of this course), and subject area knowledge when choosing a statistical model."
