You should not discuss the assignment with anyone outside your group. If you are stuck please contact your instructor. If you run into issues with your partner, let me know immediately. I can't help if it is the day before the due date and you tell me you haven't heard from him/her/them. You'll be stuck doing it yourself then. \n",

When submitting, please leave a note about how working with your group members went and if you think he/she/they gave equal effort or not. Please use the following rubric as a guide.\n",
