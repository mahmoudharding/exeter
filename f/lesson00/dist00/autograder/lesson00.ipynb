    "Welcome to Foundations of Data Science!  Throughout the course you will complete assignments like this one. You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so these assignments are an important part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on a question, so ask a post to the discussion board or ask your instructor for help. Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it. You should **not** just copy/paste someone else's code, but rather work together to gain understanding of the task you need to complete. \n",

Inline links are a design pattern that uses hyperlinked words — conventionally blue, underlined words — to guide users to another page containing related information. Designers employ inline links so that the information linked from the highlighted words does not clutter the user's current webpage. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets `( [ ] )`, and then you wrap the link in parenthesis `( ( ) )`. For example, to create a hyperlink to www.ncssm.edu, with a link text that says, Visit NCSSM!, you'd write this in Markdown: `[Visit NCSSM!](www.ncssm.edu)`.\n",
