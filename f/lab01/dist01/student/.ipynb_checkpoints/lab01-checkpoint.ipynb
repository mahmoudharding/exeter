Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it. You should **not** just copy/paste someone else's code, but rather work together to gain understanding of the task you need to complete. \n",

When a cell is finished running, you'll see a number inside the brackets, like so: `In [1]`.

First, save your work by clicking **File** at the top left of your screen, then **Save Notebook**.
