    "Welcome to Lesson 11!  Throughout the course you will complete assignments like this one. You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so these assignments are an important part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on a question, so ask a post to the discussion board or ask your instructor for help. Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it. You should **not** just copy/paste someone else's code, but rather work together to gain understanding of the task you need to complete. \n",

    "To receive credit for this assignment, answer all questions correctly and submit before the deadline.\n",

If you do discuss the assignments with others **please include their names below** (it's a good way to learn your classmates' names).\n",

    "In 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Northern California presented a [report](https://www.aclunc.org/sites/default/files/racial_and_ethnic_disparities_in_alameda_county_jury_pools.pdf) on jury selection in Alameda County, California. The report concluded that certain racial and ethnic groups are underrepresented among jury panelists in Alameda County, and suggested some reforms of the process by which eligible jurors are assigned to panels. In this section, we will analyze the data provided by the ACLU.
